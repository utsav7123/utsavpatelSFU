                <p class="intro">
                    Hi, I am Utsav Patel, a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University. I love programming, and for me, it all starts with logic and creative problem-solving. Python is my favorite language, and I am always excited by the possibilities in artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                
                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3>Skills and Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a wide range of experience in web development, including both front end and back end, as well as AI model training, building data pipelines, database management, and game development. I enjoy creating games to play with my friends, and every new project becomes my favorite because I always try to make it the best I can.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, I used to be an artist and photographer before programming took over all my free time. I still bring my creative side to my projects, whether I am solving a tough problem or designing a new feature. My proudest project so far is a vacuum cleaner AI that locates and cleans dust in the most efficient way, showing how simple ideas can be turned into clever solutions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3>Work Style</h3>
                    <p>
                        I usually prefer working solo because I enjoy building things from scratch and choosing my own approach, but I am comfortable joining existing projects and adding new features too. My friends and classmates know that if something is assigned to me, I will get it done. I am consistent, reliable, and always happy to help others when they are stuck. I also love to share my knowledge without judgment, making learning and teamwork enjoyable for everyone.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about the gaming industry, especially about building AI that makes games more exciting and realistic. I am eager to start my career with a major tech company. The idea of working at places like Microsoft, Google, or even TransLink in Vancouver inspires me because these companies have a real impact on peopleâ€™s daily lives. My resume may not fully show how hardworking or friendly I am, but I always use my full potential to solve problems and help my team grow. I am ready to learn and make a difference wherever I go.
