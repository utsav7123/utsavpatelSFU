            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Hi, I am Utsav Patel, a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University. I love programming, and for me, it all starts with logic and creative problem-solving. Python is my favorite language, and I am passionate about artificial intelligence. I also have a wide range of experience in web development, both front end and back end, as well as AI model training, building data pipelines, and working with databases.

One of my favorite things is making games that I can play with friends during lectures. I like turning simple ideas into something interactive and fun. Every time I work on a new project, it becomes my favorite, because I always do my best to make each one better than the last. If I had to pick just one, I am especially proud of a vacuum cleaner AI project I built for my AI course. The program finds dust in a room and cleans it in the most efficient way. It is a simple idea, but it took a lot of careful logic and planning to get it right.

I usually prefer working solo, because I like naming my own variables and building things from scratch, but I am also comfortable joining existing projects and adding new features. I love the feeling of bringing an idea to life and making sure everything works smoothly. My friends and classmates know that if something is assigned to me, it will get done. I am consistent, I take pride in finishing my work on time, and I am always willing to help others when they are stuck.

Outside of coding, I used to be very active in art and photography before I discovered how much I enjoy programming. These days, I spend most of my time coding, but my creative side is still a big part of how I approach problems and design solutions.

Helping people gives me a lot of satisfaction. I like solving problems for others and explaining solutions in a way that is easy to understand. I believe everyone is always learning, and I never judge someone for not knowing something. Instead, I try to make learning and teamwork enjoyable.

I am passionate about the gaming industry, especially about creating AI that makes games more exciting and realistic. Looking ahead, I am eager to start my career with a major tech company. The thought of working at a place like Microsoft, Google, ChatGPT, or even TransLink in Vancouver really inspires me, because these companies have a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives.

My resume might not show just how hardworking I am or how much I care about my work, but I always use my full potential to solve problems and help my team. I am friendly, open to learning, and excited to grow wherever I go.

Thank you for visiting my site. I am always happy to connect and see what we can build together.</p>
